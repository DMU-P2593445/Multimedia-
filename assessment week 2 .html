<h2>My Kittens</h2>
<p style="color: pink">Last november we rescued two little british Shorthair kittens. Their names are Beryl and Bunty and they are my little fat baby kittens. I love the a lot. Too much maybe? yes.</p>
<h3>My Dogs</h3>
<p style="color: teal">I am very lucky to have two chocolate labradors called Freddie and Humphrey. Fred was 9 this year and now that he is an old man hes a bit smelly and slow but still the most cuddley dog in the world. Humphrey is only 3 but seems to be turning more puppish as he is getting older. He spends his days running and wiggling.</p>
